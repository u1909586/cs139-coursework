Hello, and welcome to a website created by a first year student u1909586 (Dmitrijs G.)

This website allows a user to create one-off expenses to be paid by people,
or create a group of people that will have more than one expense - e.g. a house hold.

The additional features
- user can choose to pay all or just a part of the expense
- user can create a one-off expense or multiple expenses for a group of people
- user is able to view the expenses that they have set and their current status
- user can also delete the expenses or the groups that they have created if all the expenses are paid
or the user doesn't require them anymore.
- Users security is always a priority, and therefor the passwords are hashed as well as made secure by you (your passwords should contain uppercase, lowercase, number and special character)
