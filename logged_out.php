  <h1>Hello, and welcome to Wise Split</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Here you can add expenses that have to be settled by a group of people.</h2>
  <h3>Make it easy for yourself, track any expenses you are owed or that you owe.</h3>
  <h3>Others will get an email and website notification of repayments.</h3>
  <h2>It's easy to use, just add people with their email addresses and the money they owe. Once they have paid you will be updated on the payment!</h2>
  <h2>If they don't have an account but you already added their expenses that they owe, then it will be simple for them to access them. Just give them the email that you used to create their expense. And once they signup with that email, they will see all of the expenses.</h2>
  <h1>Simple as that!</h1>
